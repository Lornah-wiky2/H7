## A Literature Review of Cyber Security

https://www.ijrar.org/papers/IJRAR1CBP189.pdf 

The attached article is a literature review on cybersecurity that explores the differences between cybersecurity and information security.

- Cyber security and information security are not completely interchangeable,  while they share similarities, cyber security encompasses a broader scope that includes the protection of individuals as well as data.

- Cyber security has become a global priority,  with over 50 countries publishing official strategies to address issues related to cyberspace and cybercrime.

- The traditional CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) model is insufficient for addressing the complexities of modern cyber threats, necessitating a broader understanding of security attributes.

- Information protection is a process, not merely a technological solution, requiring a comprehensive approach that extends beyond software to include policies and human factors.

- ICT security is a subset of information security, focusing specifically on securing technology-based systems that store or transfer information.

- Cyber security incidents can lead to violations of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, but also involve unique risks not covered by traditional information security definitions.

- Training is essential for combating cyber threats, with programs aimed at both security professionals and general users to enhance awareness and skills in defense against cyber attacks.

- Emerging technologies like deep learning are increasingly utilized in intrusion detection systems to improve the identification and classification of cyber threats.

The paper discusses various frameworks and standards for cyber defense, emphasizing the need for national policies to secure cyberspace effectively. It also offers a broad yet focused examination of current cybersecurity trends, making it an excellent starting point for those seeking a quick but comprehensive overview of the field.

### REVIEW AND COMMENTS : 

The article, titled "Human-AI coevolution," discusses the emerging field of study focused on the continuous interaction and mutual influence between humans and AI algorithms, particularly in the context of recommender systems. Here's a brief summary of the key points:

-  Recommender systems play a central role in human-AI coevolution, influencing user choices on online platforms.

- The interaction creates a feedback loop in which user choices generate data for AI training, which then shapes future user preferences.

- This feedback loop has unique characteristics like pervasiveness, persuasiveness, traceability, speed, and complexity.

- Potential unintended consequences include echo chambers, filter bubbles, and increased inequality.

- The field requires an interdisciplinary approach, combining artificial intelligence and complexity science.

- Research challenges faced in this study  include understanding the impact of the feedback loop on human-AI ecosystems and developing new analytical frameworks.

- A "society-centered AI" perspective is proposed, emphasizing societal-level impacts and the need for legal and political interventions.

- The Research methodologies used  include empirical studies based on real user data and simulation studies using various models.

The paper calls for a comprehensive interdisciplinary study of human-AI coevolution at the intersection of artificial intelligence and complexity science. It also highlights the importance of understanding human-AI coevolution for making informed decisions about the future of AI and its impact on society

## Top 16 cybersecurity threats in 2024

https://www.embroker.com/blog/top-cybersecurity-threats/#top_16_cybersecurity_threats_in_2024 


The attached article discusses the top 16 cybersecurity threats expected in 2024, highlighting key risks businesses and individuals face in the digital landscape. 
### The content stated and highlighted below is based on skimming. 

- Social engineering remains a top threat, with 74% of data breaches involving human interaction, making it easier for attackers to exploit human error rather than technical vulnerabilities.

- Third-party exposure is increasing, with 29% of data breaches in 2023 attributed to attacks on less-secure third-party networks.

- Configuration mistakes in security systems can lead to vulnerabilities; over 8,000 servers were found to be at risk due to misconfigurations in 2023.

- Artificial intelligence is being weaponized by cybercriminals, who use machine learning to automate and enhance the sophistication of their attacks, leading to a rise in frequency and complexity.

- DNS tunneling is a common attack vector, allowing cybercriminals to send and receive data by disguising it within normal DNS requests, bypassing firewalls.

- Insider threats pose significant risks, with both intentional and accidental breaches occurring from individuals within organizations who have access to sensitive information.

- State-sponsored attacks are on the rise, targeting critical infrastructure and government networks, often for espionage or disruption purposes.

- Ransomware attacks are becoming more costly, with average ransom fees increasing from $400,000 to $2 million between 2023 and 2024, significantly impacting businesses financially.

- Trojan horses remain prevalent, often disguised as legitimate software, allowing attackers to infiltrate networks or steal sensitive information.

- Drive-by cyberattacks can occur without user consent, silently downloading malware when users visit compromised websites.

- Poor cyber hygiene practices increase vulnerability; many organizations fail to implement basic security measures like password managers and two-factor authentication.

- Cloud vulnerabilities have surged by 154%, highlighting the risks associated with misconfigurations in cloud services that can lead to massive data breaches.

- Mobile devices are increasingly targeted, as they often lack robust security measures and carry sensitive personal information, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals.
